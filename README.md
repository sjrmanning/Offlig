# Offlig — Office Code Pro with Ligatures

**Offlig** is a very slightly modified version of [@nathco](https://github.com/nathco)’s **Office Code Pro**, itself a fork of the monospaced sans serif **Source Code Pro** originally created by Paul D. Hunt for Adobe Systems Incorporated. Please see the [Office Code Pro](https://github.com/nathco/Office-Code-Pro) repository for more information.

Offlig uses [@phooky](https://github.com/phooky)’s [fork of Office Code Pro](https://github.com/phooky/Office-Code-Pro) which fixes some width issues with Office Code Pro, but also includes a dotted zero variant.

## Preview

Code examples taken from [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode)’s set of examples.

## Font Variants

As with Office Code Pro, there is a slashed zero and dotted zero (_Offlig D_) variant.

## Ligatures

The ligatures in Offlig were added via [Ligaturizer](https://github.com/ToxicFrog/Ligaturizer) using the ligature set from [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode). I had initially tried to use ligatures from [Hasklig](https://github.com/i-tu/Hasklig), thinking that they would fit the style of Source Code Pro/Office Code Pro better, but ran into issues getting this to work with Ligaturizer. If anyone has any luck with this, please open a PR with the OTF/TTF files!
